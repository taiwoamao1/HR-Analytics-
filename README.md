### Data sources
Data was generated from a business simulation game, carried out for 6 years. 

### Tools

- Simulation tool to generate data.
- Excel - analyse and report.
- Tableau -Report

### Data Preparation 
- The business requirements are identified for the project.
- Data was collected from the outcome of the business game simulation.
- Prepared the data.
- Analysed the data.
- Visualised the data. 


### Data Analysis
- Excel was used for analysis.

  
### Results
  The analysis results are summarised as follows:
  - The company incurred a high amount  on wage, training, and automation costs  in years 2 and 3, which led to an increase in productivity levels in year 2 and year 3.
  - The company experienced a  fall in training, wage and automation costs  in years 4 and 5. This led to  high redundancy and many strike days. 
  
  

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I would recommend the following actions:
- The company should invest more in sustainability.
- The company should increase training costs and wage costs.
- Encourage good staff morale, the increase in several strike days and redundancy can affect the company's image.

### Limitations 
- Limited time constraints and availability of some data.
- There was a limitation in the choice of industry; other sectors should be allowed for gainful insight into the firm's productivity.
- The simulation is limited to classroom learning; a real-life situation should have been suggested because of the management world.
